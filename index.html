        <p>Hi all! My name is Ethan Shirley and I'm from Gilbert, Arizona. I enjoy spending time with my wife, playing
            board games, video games, ultimate frisbee, hiking, escape rooms, and a bunch of other activities. I love
            problem solving and finding innovative ways to better the environment around me. I've taken a huge interest
            in learning how to code video games and love seeing a project come to life. I'm currently enrolled in BYU
            Pathway with a focus on Software Development. I know small steps will help me reach my destination
            eventually. </p>

        <p>Arizona is home for me. Growing up in the desert has taught me to value the importance of water. It is
            jokingly said
            that Winter is hot and Summer is hotter. Arizona is home to plenty of cacti as well as bringing monsoon
            season before autumn begins. A common invitation from the locals is to stay and watch the sunsets as they
            truly are a once in a lifetime experience.</p>
