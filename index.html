        <p>Hi all! My name is Ethan Shirley and I'm from Gilbert, Arizona. I enjoy spending time with my wife, playing
            board games, video games, ultimate frisbee, hiking, escape rooms, and a bunch of other activities. I love
            problem solving and finding innovative ways to better the environment around me. I've taken a huge interest
            in learning how to code video games and love seeing a project come to life. I'm currently enrolled in BYU
            Pathway with a focus on Software Development. I know small steps will help me reach my destination
            eventually. </p>
